Some code asserts whether the base folder is TacViewStats, thus will become a problem is a user renames it (needs to be changed)


Will add command line arguments to alter program function
Will add user GUI in the distant future for ease-of-use

Future functions:

	- process and output data to a file/database for broader data analysis
	- be able to output data to google.docs
	- determine whether whole/part of a file is already contained within database
	- allow error 'holding'/'skipping' to prevent process stopping halfway through
		- gather logs from files and print at the end

	- choose specific time-frames or conditions to gather data at
	- choose how to output the data
	- write between reading files or only at the end
